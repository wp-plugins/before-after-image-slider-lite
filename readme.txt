== Usage ==

= Shortcode Generator =

To be a able to use the handy shortcode generator, you have to install the optional Vafpress framework.
Set [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/before-after-image-slider-lite/faq/) for this.

**Hint**: After you've created your pages, you can safely deactivate (and remove) Vafpress again. It is only needed for this editor functionality.

**Note**: The generator currently only works in the visual editor mode.

= Shortcode =

The basic shortcode looks like this:

`[image-comparator][/image-comparator]`

You may use the following parameters:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>**left**</td>
        <td>(**Required**) Url or id of the left image.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>left_alt</td>
        <td>"alt" attribute of the left image.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>**right**</td>
        <td>(**Required**) Url or id of the right image.</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>right_alt</td>
        <td>"alt" attribute of the right image.</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>title</td>
        <td>Optional title.</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>width</td>
        <td>Optional width, i.e. 70%.</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>classes</td>
        <td>Additional CSS classes. **Hint** Use 'hover' to enable a mouse hover effect-</td>
    </tr>
</table>

= Shortcode Examples =

Just images:

`[image-comparator left="http://.../left.jpg" right="http://.../right.jpg"][/image-comparator]`

When you know the media id of the images you can do it like this:

`[image-comparator left="123" right="456"][/image-comparator]`

(This will also let you translate the media using WPML.)

Enable hover effect:
`[image-comparator classes="hover"][/image-comparator]`

Full example:

    [image-comparator
        left="http://test.moewe-studio.com/before-after-image-slider-lite/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/03/cobra_blend_right1.jpg"
        left_alt="The cobra is red"
        right="http://test.moewe-studio.com/before-after-image-slider-lite/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/03/cobra_blend_left.jpg"
        right_alt="The cobra is black"
        width="70%" classes="hover"
        title="With hover (just move the mouse)"]
    [/image-comparator]
